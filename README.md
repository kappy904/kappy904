Hey there! I’m Kapeesh, a Front-End Developer with 13 years of experience. You can call me Kappy if you’d like. For more info about me, feel free to check out my portfolio [here](https://kapeesh.dev/).

## Communication

My day is divided into planning for SU, code reviews, catch-ups, and the afternoon is reserved for deep work.

- I prefer Teams, which I respond to frequently with a 1-2 hour delay.
- The best time to reach me is in the morning. For any emergencies, please feel free to call me.
- I love keeping a paper trail, so feel free to check my tickets for updates rather than messaging everyone in a channel/team chat.

## Collaboration

I love pair programming. Feel free to plan a session or invite me to join you. I appreciate the time taken for code reviews, and if I find them to be highly logical, I always check them out and run them locally. I am very “to the point” with my code reviews and do not take feedback personally.

When providing feedback, I follow this pattern:

1. **Nit:** 
2. **Question:** 
3. **Suggestion:** 
4. **Recommendation:** 
5. **Changes Requested:** 

I am always open to discussions and sometimes get carried away with clean code and good practices. :)

## Expectations from Others

- **Ticket Confirmation:** If I tag you in a ticket, I would appreciate a confirmation that you have received it—an emoji reaction is fine. This way, the next time we speak, I don’t have to ask, “Did you see my message?”
  
- **Ticket Responsibility:** If you are assigned to a ticket, I expect you to take full responsibility for it until completion. For handovers, I expect a meeting, chat, or verbal discussion to adequately prepare me to take over the task. A paper trail is important because I could also hand over said ticket to someone else.
  
- **Non-Urgent Tasks:** If you do not want to address something immediately, I expect you to create a ticket for it in the backlog. I do not expect something to be resolved if there is no ticket—again, paper trail.

- **Deadlines:** I treat deadlines as the highest priority. I am working in a team, and priority needs to be joint decisions.
  
- **Preferred Communication Method:** I would rather we address something via a call if there is too much back-and-forth chatting on Teams. This is best for clarification, especially for code reviews.
  
- **Code Quality:** I take clean code and code quality very seriously. Therefore, I may appear strict when doing code reviews. Please do not take this personally; it’s about the code and delivering a product to the business that will be robust and sustainable in the long run. Everything is open for discussion, and I do not expect you to be forced to act on anything I say.
